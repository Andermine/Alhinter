> This pack is still in the development phase, so bugs and issues are to be expected

An overworld configuration pack for terra 6.4 and higher. It is based on and merges the Origen config pack and the default terra overworld config pack v2.0,you can find links to both below.
A lot of content is used from both packs, especially regarding the terrain features such as trees, flora and palettes.
[Overworld Config pack 2.0](https://github.com/PolyhedralDev/TerraOverworldConfig/tree/2.0).
[Origen Config pack](https://github.com/Rearth/Origen).

Alhinter will be focused on overhauling all Overworld Generation, like the packs mentioned.
